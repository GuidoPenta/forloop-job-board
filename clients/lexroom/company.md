**At Lexroom.ai, the mission is to give superpowers to lawyers and let them complete hours of work in seconds.**

Lexroom is part of the legal industry revolution driven by Generative AI. So far, the results are promising: customers
grew 5x in the last 5 months, and over half of them save 8+ hours a week on research and drafting with the product.

They are looking to grow their tech team with a Junior Software Engineer who will work directly with the CTO (Andrea) on
some of the most complex challenges in Generative AI implementation.

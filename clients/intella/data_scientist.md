As a Data Scientist, you’ll work on developing machine learning and statistical models for telemetry and satellite data.
You’ll experiment with new approaches, refine existing solutions, and build libraries for advanced algorithms.
Collaborating closely with Machine Learning Engineers and Data Engineers, you’ll ensure models are effectively deployed
and scaled for production.

**Key Responsibilities**

- Develop machine learning and statistical models for satellite and telemetry data.
- Identify and propose innovative algorithms and solutions to real-world problems.
- Optimize, maintain, and refine existing models and methodologies.
- Experiment with new techniques and build libraries for algorithm development.
- Collaborate with the team to deploy and scale models in production environments with real-world data
- Stay updated on the latest developments in machine learning and AI, contributing to open-source projects and community
  initiatives.

**Requirements**

- Strong experience in Python and familiarity with deep neural networks and classical machine learning methods (Pytorch,
  Tensorflow, Jax).
- Knowledge of Python Libraries for data management, machine learning, and database management systems.
- Proven track record of deploying and maintaining machine learning models or statistical and mathematical models in
  production environments with examples of projects and tools you develop.
- A public profile showcasing experiments or projects (e.g., GitHub, Kaggle, GitLab). Or proprietary but shareable
  examples during the interview.
- A passion for AI and machine learning, with a commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
- Excellent problem-solving skills, along with the ability to work independently and collaboratively in a remote
  setting.

**Additional knowledge (beneficial)**

- Understanding of the aerospace industry and satellite operations.
- Experience in deploying machine learning models in realistic production settings.
- Familiarity with Rust, C++ or other low-level programming languages
